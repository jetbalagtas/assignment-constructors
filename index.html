        <h1>TEOTWAWKI<br>
          <small>A Shooting War Between the U.S. and China</small></h1>
            <p>
              China and the United States have been at odds over several international and domestic disputes. From cyberwarfare, trade deficits, to human rights, and to China's open agression in Southeast Asia, where it has built military installations on hotly disputed sparse islands whose ownership is contested by several ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tensions have never been greater. Exacerbating the situation is China's muscle-flexing and widely reported 'bullying' of it's much smaller and less powerful neighbors. It's navy ships agressively maneuver to collide with the smaller fishing boats of it's neighbors, warning them over loudspeaker and radio calls that they are tresspassing on Chinese waters. These incidents have been growing in number. Even U.S. military spy planes flying in the established international zone, have been warned by the Chinese bases over radio about flying over Chinese airspace.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, the United States is challenging China's misplaced resolve by sending a battleship in those international waters. The mission is to ensure free navigation of the seas for all ships including all navies, private, and commercial vessels.
            </p>

            <p>
              The United States has the most powerful naval force in the world. It has 10 Carrier Strike Groups. 3 of which are contantly at sea for ready deployment and projection of power. These CSGs have a phalanx of ships including 1 aircraft carrier a host of attack and defense frigates, destroyers, battleships, and a couple of nuclear powered submarines. They never have to dock for fuel and supplies, and are supported by hundreds of logistics ships.
            </p>

            <p>
              China on the other hand, has been struggling to match the naval power of the United States, even if only in photo ops where they display the only aircraft carrier they have which is an old refurbished one they bought from the former Soviet Union. It, together with out-of-place ships in photos the Chinese government released have impressed the untrained eye. But to the acutely aware and savvy military watcher, China has revealed glaring weaknesses, incompetence of its commanders, or just plain theatrics of its political rulers. The most glaring of which is that this force can never stray too far from the mainland due to the lack of logistics support.
            </p>

            <p>
              It remains to be seen if China's reckless actions will be backed up by their chain of command, should an incident occur that normally would represent an act of war.
            </p>

            <p>
              Certainly, the U.S. and its allies are watching closely.
            </p>
