        <h1>TEOTWAWKI<br>
          <small>A Shooting War Between the U.S. and China</small></h1>
            <p>
              China and the United States have been at odds over several international and domestic disputes. From
          cyberwarfare, trade deficits, to human rights, and to China's open agression in Southeast Asia, where it has built military installations on sparse islands whose ownership is contested by several ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tensions have never been greater. Exacerbating the situation is China's muscle-flexing and widely reported bullying of it's much smaller and less powerful neighbors. It's navy ships agressively maneuvering to collide with the smaller fishing boats of it's neighbors and warning them over loudspeaker and radio calls to that they are tresspassing on Chinese waters, these incidents have been growing by the number. Even U.S. military spy planes flying in the area, an international zone, have been warned by the Chinese bases over radio.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, the United States is challenging the Asian bully by sending a battleship in those international waters, purportedly to ensure free navigation of the seas both for navies, private, and commercial vessels.
